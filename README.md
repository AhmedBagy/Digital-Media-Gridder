# Digital-Media-Gridder

From my practical experience in digital media house, operators receive assets with fixed ratio 16:9, But infact there's black bars, These bars are quite challenging to detemine the actual asset ratio. So, 
I created numerous tools to help detecting ratios, Some of the tools are human based others are automatically detected. 

The .bat code is original to me, open sources are used here;
- Handbreak.
- FFplay.
